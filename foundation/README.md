# AZT Foundation · Static Website

A fast, accessible, static site for the AZT Foundation.

## Structure
- `index.html` (home), `about.html`, `programs.html`, `impact.html`, `resources.html`, `get-involved.html`, `contact.html`, `bylaws.html`
- `assets/images/*` — logo.svg, hero.svg, placeholder avatars, favicon.svg
- `assets/css/style.css` — core styles
- `assets/js/main.js` — tiny progressive enhancement

## Customize
- Replace placeholder images in `assets/images/`.
- Update content in each page as needed.
- Wire up Donate and Contact form to your chosen services (e.g., Stripe/Donorbox, Netlify Forms).

## Deploy
- **GitHub Pages:** push this folder to a repo and enable Pages with root as the site.
- **Netlify/Vercel:** drag‑and‑drop the folder or connect the repository.

## Accessibility & Performance
- Semantic HTML, focus outlines, responsive typography, and minimal JS.
- Preloads key imagery and uses SVG for crisp, small assets.
